# VirtusLab-Java

An exercise for a Java internship at VirtusLab. On the REST server side it uses the Spring Framework.
To try-out the REST endpoint you can use the already existing test or run the MainApp class and send
a POST request through Postman to http://localhost:8080/receipt with the basket info in form of a JSON in the body section.
